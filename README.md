# 🛒 Customer Segmentation & Retention Analysis - RFM & Treemap Visualization
## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation and retention analysis using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scoring and visualization with a Treemap Chart. The goal is to categorize customers into different segments based on their behavior, understand each segment's contribution to the business, and provide actionable insights that can enhance customer retention and marketing strategies.

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis comes from a real-world online retail transaction record. It includes the sales transactions occurring between 2010 and 2011, and consists of:

order_id
product_code
product_name
quantity
order_date
price
customer_id
You can download the dataset from this Google Drive link.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
For this project, the following tools and libraries were used:

Python: For data manipulation and analysis
Pandas: To clean and preprocess the data
Plotly: For interactive visualizations, including Treemap
Seaborn: For statistical data visualizations
Jupyter Notebook: As the development environment

## 📈 Key Analysis: RFM & Customer Segmentation
The analysis is focused on creating customer segments using RFM analysis:

Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase
Frequency (F): How often a customer makes a purchase
Monetary (M): How much money a customer spends
Segmentation: Customers are categorized into segments such as "Champions", "Loyal Customers", "At Risk", and "Hibernating".
Insights: This analysis helps businesses identify high-value customers and those at risk of churn, enabling targeted marketing efforts.

## 🔍 Key Findings
High Contribution Segments: "Hibernating" and "Champions" make up the largest portions of the customer base.
At Risk: A significant number of customers fall into the "At Risk" segment, which indicates a need for targeted retention efforts.
Loyal Customers: The "Loyal Customers" and "Champions" segments show strong engagement and account for a large share of the business's revenue.
